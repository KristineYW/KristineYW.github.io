Do vaccines have a role in the 21st century as life expectancy is high and child mortality is low?

There is a general, happy consensus that life expectancy is increasing around the world as child mortality is going down. Does this mean that vaccinations are no longer necessary, or does it still have any benefits in the 21st century?

Check out my new post on [medium](https://medium.com/@ywang03/do-vaccines-really-have-any-effect-on-life-and-death-9dfd71e4e529/) to find out more about vaccination through data. 

Copies of the datasets I used and clean-up/visualizations can be found on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KristineYW/DS-Unit-1-Build).
