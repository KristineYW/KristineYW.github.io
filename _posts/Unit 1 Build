There is a general, happy consensus that life expectancy is increasing around the world as child mortality is going down. Does this mean that vaccinations are no longer mandatory, or does it still play a role in the 21st century?

Check out my new post on [medium](https://medium.com/@ywang03/do-vaccines-really-have-any-effect-on-life-and-death-9dfd71e4e529/) to find out more about vaccination through data. 

Copies of the datasets I used and clean-up/visualizations can be found on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KristineYW/DS-Unit-1-Build).
